Manual Implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Algorithm
📖 Overview
This project features a manual implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm, developed to deepen my understanding of its mechanics and to refine my algorithm development skills.
By creating the algorithm from scratch, I explored the foundational concepts of distance metrics, classification, and decision boundaries without relying on libraries like scikit-learn.

💡 Motivation
The primary motivation for this project was to:
Test my knowledge of the k-NN algorithm by implementing it manually.
Practice fundamental algorithm design and programming skills.
Gain a deeper understanding of the algorithm's inner workings, such as distance calculations and voting mechanisms.
